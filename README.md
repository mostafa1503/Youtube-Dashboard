The YouTube Trending Dashboard provides an interactive analysis of trending videos on YouTube using Power BI. It includes key metrics such as total views, number of trending videos, likes, dislikes, and the number of channels. The dashboard visualizes trends over time through a line chart showing the number of trending videos per month. It also highlights the top five trending videos by views and the top five channels with the highest number of trending videos. A pie chart represents the most popular categories, while a world map displays the distribution of trending videos across different countries. Users can apply filters to analyze data by channel, country, or year, making it easier to explore specific trends and insights.
